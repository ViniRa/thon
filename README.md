# Amazon Fine Foods Reviews
A series of NLP projects using the Amazon Fine Food Reviews dataset. This repository is a work in progress. I will add projects as inspiration comes. 

## Project One: Predicting Review Helpfulness Using Macro-Level Text Summary Statistics

### Summary and Motivation  

The goal of this project is to determine if a review's helpfulness can be predicted without using word specific features (i.e. bag of words and its derivatives). Instead I used macro-level text summary statistics such as:  

1. Number of Sentences
2. Number of Words
3. Readability 
4. Sentiment Metrics

The motivations are multi-fold: I am curious about the predictive power of macro-level text summary statistics and using word-specific features can make training, storing, and deploying predictive models fairly computational intensive. 

### Results 

The preliminary analysis shows that a reasonably predictive model can be build without word specific features:  

![alt text](https://github.com/jcharit1/Amazon-Fine-Foods-Reviews/blob/master/plots/ROC_Basic.png "AUC ROC on Test Data of Basic Models")  

The best models, k-nearest neighbors and random forest, achieved AUC ROC of 0.8 and 0.81 respectively. While these models are not "highly predictive" (AUC ROC of 0.9+), this is a proof of concept. With more aggressive model training and a more diverse set of macro-level text summary statistics, perhaps the performance of models with word-specific features can be rivaled.

### Strategy and Tools

For its combination of speed and parsimony, I used spacy to process the text and count the number of words/sentences. The package textstat was used for the readability score (Automated Readability Index) and the NLTK package was used for sentiment analysis. All the machine learning was done with scikit-learn.

### Next Steps

Next I want to improve the model performance by experimenting with a more diverse set of macro-level text summary statistics. I will try:

1. Different measures of text readability
2. Using sentence, as oppose to whole-review level, measures of sentiment
3. Use vector representations of words to capture semantic summaries of reviews
4. Use topic modeling to identify topics that are highly predictive of review usefulness

## Installing

Uses Python 3.5 and anaconda

### Linux 
1. Change into the directory where you want to place the repo
2. Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/jcharit1/Amazon-Fine-Foods-Reviews.git`
3. Change into repo directory: `cd Amazon-Fine-Foods-Reviews/`
4. Edit the environment file prefix (at the end) to reflect your anaconda directory
4. Copy the environment `conda env create -f environment.yml`
5. Load the environment: `source activate py35`
6. Open the notebooks: `jupyter notebook`

Copying the full python environment will take 10-15 minutes on a slow internet connection. However, OS specifics aside, it will get you a full mirror of my python environment. Then you should be able run all the notebooks and scripts with, hopefully, no errors.

I didn't include the raw data for avoid slowing down git commits. It can be found here: [link to raw data](https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)
